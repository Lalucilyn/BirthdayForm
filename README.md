This project was made as a test from Intive - FDV

A couple of notes about some choices I made during this project:

- Since the greetings message is in the future tense ("you will be..."), when the user's birthday matches the current date, I chose to display their future age (IE: how old they'll be on their next birthday).

- Past records are saved in Localstorage so they can be retrieved when refreshing or leaving the page.

- I tried to keep the layout as similar to the mockup as possible but I did add some styling and a couple extra messages (for example, an error message displays if the form is not properly completed). I also added some short media queries to assure it displays well on mobile devices.
